# Blog Application

This is a full-stack blog application built with React frontend and Node.js backend.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into two main directories:
- `frontend/`: React application
- `backend/`: Node.js server

## Frontend Setup

The frontend is built with Create React App. To get started:

### Prerequisites

cd frontend
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

### Available Scripts

In the frontend directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.

#### `npm run build`
